				<h4>Here are some aspects of my teaching philosophy:</h4><br>
				<strong><em>Meta-learning is a gift that keeps giving.</em></strong> As an educator, I aim to be communicative and transparent with my students about my teaching strategies in order to foster a higher-level understanding of what methodologies help them learn best. This might be different depending on the person and so it's also important that I provide students with multiple strategies and channels for communication.<br><br>
				<strong><em>Combining practice and theory.</em></strong> When I teach coding, I try to have a balance between teaching syntax and teaching the theory that underlies that syntax. It's important that students are able to delve into code in a hands-on way but at the same time, if students understand the conceptual logic behind what they are programming, they will be able to ask the right questions and find the right resources to fill in the blanks when it comes to syntax. 
				<br><br>
				<strong><em>Creating Collaborative Community Guidelines.</em></strong> I always start every course with having students define what they want out of their classroom community. Students agree on guidelines that can be about what makes them feel like they are respected or in a safe space. We create a collaborative community guidelines document that can be amended at any point in the semester, and serves as a reference point that we can return to if needed.<br><br>
				<strong><em>Engaging Critically with Technology.</em></strong> Being able to engage critically with the technology we use is essential in unpacking the biases embedded in them and in creating more community-centric methods of working with technology. For this reason, it is important even when teaching a technical coding course to incorporate social and historical context to the material.<br><br>
				<strong><em>Commitment to Diversity.</em></strong> As a racialized femme person working in the tech industry and in academia it is so painfully apparent to me that we need to do a better job of centering marginalized voices. When I teach, I try to highlight black, brown, femme, nonbinary, queer, indigenous and other marginalized voices in art and technology because it is important that we dispel the patriarchal mythos around tech and because it is inspiring to introduce students to artists and technologists that are making such important, beautiful and critical work.
